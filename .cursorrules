# Cursor AI Rules for climenu

## Project Context
This is an R package providing interactive CLI menus. Keep code lightweight and terminal-focused.

## Code Style
- 2-space indentation
- snake_case naming
- Use cli::cli_* for messages
- Allow cat() for terminal output
- No line length limit but keep readable

## Key Guidelines
- Keep dependencies minimal
- Maintain cross-platform compatibility
- Graceful fallbacks for non-interactive mode
- Test in both keypress and readline modes

## Avoid
- Adding heavy dependencies
- Platform-specific code without fallbacks
- Breaking changes to public API
- Over-engineering simple features
